Hello there 👋,

Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Nelson, known online as NelsonGon, a developer who specialises in
simplifying computational work to make it more accessible. 

- ♥  As a student, my current interests lie in applying computational models to biomedical research. 

- 👷 I am currently working on [cytounet](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/cytounet), a Keras based deep
 learning package that aims to make biomedical image segmentation easier. ‍

- 📚  Outside class, I am currently improving my python proficiency while learning more about deep
learning and its broad applications. 
 
- 💻 I am an open source advocate and have contributed several `R` and `python` [packages](https://nelson-gon.github.io/projects)
whose code can be freely browsed, improved, and critiqued. I have also contributed to some open source packages
including [similiars](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/similiars), a package focused on string (dis)similarity.

- 💬 Ask me about  Biology, `R`, `python`, `bash`, `Linux`, and football(soccer). 

- 📫 To contact me,please use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bionelsongon) or
contact me [here](https://nelson-gon.github.io/social/). For feedback about my work, please open an issue at the relevant [repository](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language).
For general programming questions, please ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). I use the site regularly and will be happy to answer
your question whenever possible. 


Thank you 🖤
